## Description
This repository contains a fitness tracking application that primarily utilizes mongodb and java script to create workouts with customizable exercises. 

Now that covid is coming to an end, it is a fact that the average person has turned into a formless girthy blob due to the restrictions on attending gyms and being outside. One of the hardest things to do is get back in shape and on track after a long athletic layoff. It is difficult because we have broken our pre workout routine. In order to make this transition less difficult it is a great idea to use some form of fitness tracking to monitor our progress and design our workouts. An application that stores previous workouts is perfect for this.


## Development
To begin starter front files were created for the different html pages along with their respective frontend javascript files and  with css, node modules were imported. Next node mole was created to develop the schema for the database. Next a router file was created to handle the different html and api routes. For the api routes functions were created to create workouts, add exercises and view cumulative states of the past 7 exercises. Lastly the app was linked to atlas db and deployed to heroku

## Instillation
To use the app simply use the heroku app link https://fitnessssss.herokuapp.com/


## Usage
To use the app once on the home page, click start new workout or continue the precious. You can then decide which workout type you would like the exercises then different criterias depending on which exercise type was chosen. Info of the previous exercise will be displayed on the homepage and if the fitness tab is clicked qualitative data of the previous 7 exercises will be displayed.


## Tests
No tests were conducted in the creation of this application.
